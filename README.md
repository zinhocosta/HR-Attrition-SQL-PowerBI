## Project Description

The HR-Attrition-SQL-PowerBI project aims to provide valuable insights into employee attrition. By analyzing various factors, we can identify trends and patterns that can help organizations improve retention strategies. This project utilizes SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating the database.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards.
